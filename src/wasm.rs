//! WebAssembly bindings (enabled with `--features wasm`).
//!
//! These are the only functions the browser ever sees. Everything they
//! do is delegate to the pure-Rust API in the rest of the crate, after
//! decoding the input into typed values. We pass:
//!
//!  - **secret material as `Uint8Array`** (raw bytes). The JS caller can
//!    overwrite the buffer with `.fill(0)` once it has been persisted or
//!    used, which is the only way to make the JS-side copy of the
//!    secret unreadable to other scripts running in the page.
//!  - **public material as prefixed strings** (public keys, signatures,
//!    linking tags), both in and out — e.g. `pk_…_…`, `blsag_…_…`,
//!    `ki_…_…`. This boundary speaks the prefixed format *exclusively*;
//!    bare hex is rejected (it is only accepted by the pure-Rust library
//!    API). None of this material is secret. See [`crate::encoding`].
//!
//! Inside Rust, every temporary buffer that holds secret bytes is
//! wrapped in [`zeroize::Zeroizing`]. The wrapper ensures the WASM
//! linear-memory region containing the secret is overwritten *before*
//! its allocation is returned to the global allocator — without it, the
//! secret would persist in the heap until reallocated, where it could
//! be scraped by debuggers, core dumps, or another script with access
//! to the WASM memory.
//!
//! See the README for the full caller-side discipline; the short
//! version is "persist immediately, then `.fill(0)` the Uint8Array".
//!
//! Errors come back to JS as `JsValue::from_str(...)` so they show up
//! as plain JS `Error` strings rather than panics. We never panic
//! across the WASM boundary on bad input.
